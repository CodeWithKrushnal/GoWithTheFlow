# Interface Area Operation Progarm

The given program takes an integer value as input from the user i.e 1 or 2.

Option 1 represents Rectangle and Option 2 represents Square.

Given the metrics of the shapes are hard-coded, complete the given program to achieve the following:

1. Create an interface Quadrilateral which has the following method signatures
   - Area() int
   - Perimeter() int

2. Implement the Quadrilateral interface for the given shapes i.e Rectangle and Square

3. Define a "Print" function which accepts any shape that implements Quadrilateral interface and Prints Area and Perimeter of shape in the following manner:

   - "Area :  <value>"
   - "Perimeter :  <value>"


HINT: Step 2 means, to define methods in Quadrilateral interface for given shapes

Formulae:
- Area of Rectangle: length * width
- Perimeter of Rectangle: 2*(length + breadth)
- Area of Square: side * side
- Perimeter of Square: 4 * side
