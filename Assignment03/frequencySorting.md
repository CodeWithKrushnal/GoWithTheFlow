# Sorting on basis of frequency of word

Write a Program to fulfil the following conditions.
Input: A string containing words separated by space
Output: A slice containing words with the highest frequency in the input string.

Note: The order of the words in the resultant slice should be the same as the order they appear in the input string.
Condition: Words are case-sensitive. Joe is not the same as joe.

Given Code Template: A code template is provided that takes a string as an input and turns it into a slice of strings.

## Example Test Case 1:
- Input: My name is Joe and My Father's name is also Joe
- Output: [My name is Joe]
- Here, the words "My", "name", "is", "Joe" appeared 2 times each, which is also the highest frequency of any word. Hence the output contains all 4 words.

## Example Test Case 2:
- Input: Europe is far but the US is farther
- Output: [is]
- Here, the word "is" appeared twice which is also the highest frequency of any word.
