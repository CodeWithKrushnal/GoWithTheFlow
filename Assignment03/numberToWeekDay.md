# Number to Weekday Program

Write a program to store the day(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) against the respective index of the day(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) in a map.

You can hard-code the map in your program.

Take an integer input from the user and print the day stored against that index and if nothing is to be found for that index,
Print "Not a day"

Hint: Following code can be used to take an integer input from the user in the GO Programming Language
var index int
fmt.Scanln(&index)

## Example Test Case:

### Example 01
- Input: 5
- Output: Friday

### Example 02
- Input: 11
- Output: Not a day
