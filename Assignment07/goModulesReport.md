**Blank Imports in Go: Use Cases**

Blank imports in Go are used when a package is solely imported for its side effects, rather than for its exported functions or variables. Here are some common use cases:

* **Registering database drivers**: As in the example with the `mysql` package, blank imports are used to register the driver as a database driver in the `init()` function, without importing any other functions.
* **Initializing global variables**: Blank imports can be used to initialize global variables in a package, which are then used by other packages.
* **Side effects of imports**: Blank imports can be used to ensure that certain side effects occur when a package is imported, such as logging or setting up environment variables.

For example:
```go
import _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
```
This imports the `mysql` package solely for its side effect of registering the driver, without importing any other functions.

**When to use blank imports**

Blank imports are useful when:

* You only need the side effects of a package, not its exported functions or variables.
* You want to ensure that certain initialization or setup occurs when a package is imported.
* You want to avoid polluting your import list with unused variables or functions.
